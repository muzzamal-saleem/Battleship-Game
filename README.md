# Battleship 

We call `read_ships_file` to create a `GameBoard` for each player; then, we call `read_attacks_file` to get an Array of `Position` objects which represent the attack strategy of each player. If no attack strategy file is provided, the game controller generates 35 random attack positions and uses them instead. Each player's `GameBoard`'s `attack_pos` method is called alternately with the other player's attacks (i.e., the `Position` objects), one player's attack, then the other's. The game ends on one of these two cases:

1. All of the ships of a player are sunk (as determined by the `GameBoard`'s `all_sunk?` method)
   * The winner is that player's opponent.
2. One of the players runs out of attack moves
   * Every time its the second player's turn, the game controller checks both the attack strategy Arrays to see if there is any valid attack position left. If there is nothing left for one of the two players, the game doesn't go to the next round of attacks. We do the following to determine the winner.
   * Each `GameBoard`'s `num_successful_attacks` method is called to compare success of each player. The player that has more successfull attacks will win the game.
